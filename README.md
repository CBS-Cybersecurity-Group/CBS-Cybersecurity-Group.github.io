## Overview

This repository contains the code and assets for the CBS Cybersecurity Projects Showcase website. As a group of student researchers and part-time employees, we undertook various cybersecurity projects during our tenure. This website serves as a comprehensive showcase of our accomplishments, detailing the methodologies, tools, and outcomes of our work.

## Features

- **Project Descriptions**: In-depth information about each cybersecurity project we worked on.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs, charts, and other visual aids to better understand the project outcomes.
- **Code Repository Links**: Direct links to the GitHub repositories containing the code for each project.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [GitHub Repository Template](url_to_github_template)

## Getting Started

If you want to run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CBS-Cybersecurity-Group.github.git
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Customization

We used a GitHub repository template as a starting point for this project. To personalize it to match the CBS style and logo, we made the following customizations:

- **Logo**: Replaced the default logo with the CBS logo
- **Color Scheme**: Updated the color scheme to align with CBS branding guidelines.
- **Content**: Modified the content to accurately represent our cybersecurity projects.

Feel free to further customize the website by updating the CSS, HTML, and assets as needed.
